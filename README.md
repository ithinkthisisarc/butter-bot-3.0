# Welcome to Butter Bot 3.0

Made by your friendly neighborhood butterfly with **discord.js**


### Help Message
**Chat Commands**

Ask me questions, tell me your darkest secrets, just talk to me who cares. All you have to do is start your sentence with “`Butter`” and talk away!

**Emotes**

I’m equipped with lots of emotes, including `%cry` `%dab` `%dance` `%slap` `%hug` `%deny`

**Money Stuff** 

Do `%money` to check your balance 

Do `%coinflip` for a 50% chance at __$500__!!! 

Do `%give @user [amount]` to gift your friends money that you may or may not have. 

**Misc. Commands** 

Other random commands for you to enjoy! 

`message @user [your message]` sends an anonymous message to tagged user’s dms. For this to properly work, I need administrator permissions. 

Say `butter dm me` and I'll send you a secret message ;3 

`%user @user` gives information on a user. \n `%create link` creates a link to a message. Use ${message.guild.id}/${message.channel.id}/${message.id} to make it 

%invite` sends an invite link so you can add me to your other servers!

If you ever need help, feel free to dm my parent, @Monarrk#5707
